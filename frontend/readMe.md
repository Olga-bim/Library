# Library Website

The site works when launched through Visual Studio Code. However, after uploading it to GitHub and Render, I encountered some configuration challenges.

## Overview

This library website is designed for readers, authors, and site administrators. Currently, there is no login functionality. Users can navigate through buttons to access the book list for readers, the book addition page for authors, and the admin page for managing books, clients, and loans.

The site is built using Python and Flask, and it is hosted on Render.

## Features

### Completed:
1. Created database tables.
2. Added initial book data.
3. Added initial client and loan data.
4. Implemented CRUD operations for clients, books, and loans.
5. Verified functionality in a testing environment.
6. Added search functionality for books.
7. Created an index page and a home page for the library.
8. Developed frontend HTML pages.
9. Integrated Bootstrap components for responsive design.
10. Added logging for each function.
11. Implemented unit tests to validate initial data.
12. Modularized the codebase.
13. The site is accessible on both computers and mobile devices.
14. Deployed on GitHub and Render.
